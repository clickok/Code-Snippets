# `chmod` works by setting files for USER, GROUP, and WORLD, each via an octal
# digit. Each bit refers to a different permission, e.g., read, write, execute.
# We have: read = 4, write = 2, execute = 1
# So, for example `chmod 764 file.txt` gives the user the ability to read,
# write, and execute, the group the ability to read and write, and the world
# the ability to read only. 

# To change all directories to 755 (rwx-rx-rx), we can use `find`
find /directory/to/mod -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# To change all files to 644 (rw-r-r) we can use
find /directory/to/mod -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# To just use chmod recursively:
chmod -R 666 /path/to/dir
