# First, use lsusb and look for anything that might be a webcam
lsusb

# Then, say you got :
# Bus 001 Device 002: ID ... Webcam Corp. Webacm
# ... (Other Devices)

# You could get a verbose listing of all sorts of information via
lsusb -s 001:002 -v

# But if you just want resolution and maybe framerate, you could use
lsusb -s 001:002 -v | egrep "Width|Height|BitRate"

# Which would give you something like:
#        wWidth                            640
#        wHeight                           480
#        dwMinBitRate                 18432000
#        dwMaxBitRate                 18432000

# Divide BitRate by (Width * Height) and you get some idea of the FPS
# (depending on pixel representation, but I am not sure)
# Alternatively, you could look at "DefaultFrameInterval", which may
# give you some insight (I am assuming they are microseconds, so 
# (1000000 us / 1 s )/(33333 us/frame) = 30 frames / s, maybe
